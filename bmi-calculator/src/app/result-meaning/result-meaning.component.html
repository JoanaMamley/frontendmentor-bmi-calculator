                    A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a healthy weight may lower your chances of
                    experiencing health issues later on, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced fat and
                    sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally, strive for regular physical activity, ideally
                    about 30 minutes daily for five days a week.
